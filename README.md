# Pregnancy Care AI Assistant

## Overview
This project is an AI-powered assistant designed to revolutionize pregnancy care by offering personalized, real-time support. The assistant caters to expectant mothers' physical, emotional, and medical needs, helping alleviate stress during pregnancy, labor, and postpartum recovery.

## Problem Statement
Pregnancy care often lacks comprehensive, real-time personalized support, leaving women overwhelmed and uncertain. Traditional care methods do not adequately address the multifaceted needs of expectant mothers. This AI assistant aims to provide a solution by offering tailored support throughout pregnancy.

## Key Features
- **Pregnancy Tracking**: Monitors stages of pregnancy and provides tailored health recommendations.
- **Symptom Checker**: Uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to cross-reference symptoms with a medical database, offering potential diagnoses.
- **Medical Report Analysis**: Analyzes submitted medical reports and fetal images to provide early health insights.
- **Mental Health Support**: Offers emotional support for prepartum and postpartum depression.
- **Nutrition & Wellness Planning**: Provides personalized nutrition and fitness plans to support the well-being of expectant mothers.
- **Decision Support**: Guides users on medical care based on symptom evaluations.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Python (Flask), IBM LinuxONE (infrastructure), VSCode (development environment)

## Architecture Diagram
